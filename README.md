# Python Unofficial screeps api
## Introduction
This project's purpose is to create tools for the API of the videogame screeps. It is entirely written in python and relies on doing requests to https://screeps.com/api.
## Setup
Installation steps:
1. Install the required modules in your enviroment using pip: ***pip install -r requirements.txt***
(It is highly recommended that you install the dependencies in a virtual enviroment instead of your global python)
2. Create a file ***config.json*** containing your token surrounded by quotes, see ***example-config.json***
3. You are good to go! Run and modify main.py to interact with the screeps api.
## Notes
Project in its first steps, implementation with asyncio pending...

# Alf's unofficial screeps api in python
## Introduction
This project's purpose is to create tools that allow python users to play the videogame screeps, using the game's api. It doesn't rely on transpiling python code to javascript, but on doing requests to https://screeps.com/api
## Setup
Installation steps:
1. Install the required modules in your enviroment using pip: ***pip install -r requirements.txt***
(It is highly recommended that you install the dependencies in a virtual enviroment instead of your global python)
2. Create a file ***config.json*** containing your token surrounded by quotes, see ***example-config.json***
3. You are good to go!
## Notes
The project is in its first steps, although I'd love to allow people to participate, I'm still getting the handle on python and git. Please be patience, I'm not an experienced programmer but I'll try my best.
__Happy coding!__
